# Resume Parser Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed C++ Regex Pattern Issue**

   - Properly escaped C++ pattern in skill detection regex
   - Added fallback for regex errors when processing skills

2. **Improved Section Content Parsing**

   - Enhanced the algorithm to better detect section boundaries
   - Added support for detecting unlabeled sections based on content
   - Improved handling of content between section headers

3. **Enhanced Content-Based Classification**

   - Added more robust pattern matching for different section types
   - Implemented a cluster-based approach for classifying unclassified content
   - Added context-aware classification to better categorize ambiguous content

4. **Improved Skills Extraction**

   - Integrated simplified skills extraction approach from extractSkillsSimple.js
   - Added support for various skill formats (bullet points, categories with colons, etc.)
   - Enhanced handling of skill lists and categories

5. **Enhanced Experience and Project Extraction**
   - Added specific handling for internships, training, and work experience
   - Improved recognition of job titles and positions
   - Added context-based classification for experience items

## NEW: LLM-based Resume Extraction

We've implemented a new approach using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract structured information from resumes. This addresses several key issues:

1. **Incorrect Classification of Section Headers as Skills**

   - The LLM understands context and can distinguish between section headers and actual skills
   - Skills are explicitly limited to 1-3 word technical skills

2. **Improved Skills Identification**

   - Only extracts actual technical skills (languages, frameworks, tools)
   - Avoids extracting long phrases or soft skills

3. **Better Experience and Project Extraction**
   - Leverages the LLM's understanding of resume structure
   - Properly formats experience and project entries with titles, dates, and descriptions

### Implementation Details

1. **New LLM Extractor Service**

   - Created `services/llmResumeExtractor.js` which uses an LLM to parse resume text
   - Structured prompt ensures proper extraction of skills, experience, and projects

2. **Integrated with Existing Parser**

   - Modified `services/resumeParser.js` to try the LLM-based approach first
   - Falls back to traditional parsing if LLM is unavailable or fails

3. **Resilient to API Issues**
   - Tracks LLM API availability and avoids repeated failures
   - Implements backoff strategy for API availability issues

## Testing

The parser was tested with sample resume PDFs to verify:

- Proper section detection
- Accurate skills extraction
- Experience extraction from various formats
- Handling of non-standard resume layouts

To test the new LLM integration:

```javascript
// Test with mock LLM data
node test-llm-integration.js
```

## Remaining Work

- Continue improving project extraction for resumes that don't have explicit project sections
- Add more error handling for edge cases in PDF parsing
- Expand the pattern recognition for different resume formats
- Fine-tune the LLM prompt for better extraction
- Add caching for LLM responses to improve performance

## Usage

```javascript
import { parseResume } from "./services/resumeParser.js";

// Parse a resume from a PDF buffer (will use LLM if available, otherwise fallback to traditional)
const parsedResume = await parseResume(pdfBuffer);

// Access the extracted data
const { skills, experience, projects, rawText } = parsedResume;
```
