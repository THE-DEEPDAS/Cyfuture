- **Verification Steps**:
  1. Navigate to an application detail page
  2. Click the "Analyze Responses with AI" button
  3. Verify the button shows a countdown and is disabled
  4. Try clicking again and verify it doesn't trigger another request
  5. Wait for the countdown to complete and verify the button becomes active again
